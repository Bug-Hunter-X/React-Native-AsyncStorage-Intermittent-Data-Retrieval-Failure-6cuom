# React Native AsyncStorage Intermittent Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in a React Native application. The core problem is that data stored using AsyncStorage is not always reliably retrieved. The retrieved data might be null, undefined, or an empty string, even though data was previously stored successfully. This behavior is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce consistently.  This bug report outlines the issue, provides a code example for reproduction, and offers a potential solution.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple implementation showcasing the AsyncStorage functions.  Run this code to observe the intermittent retrieval failures.

## Potential Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` attempts to mitigate the issue by implementing error handling and data validation strategies, improving data persistence consistency.  Try running `bugSolution.js` to compare results and observe the improved reliability.
